# CMD Module in Python

The `cmd` module provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters. These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools, and prototypes that will later be wrapped in a more sophisticated interface.

## Importing the CMD Module

To use the `cmd` module, you need to import it first. Here is how you can do it:

```python
import cmd
```

## Commonly Used Functions

Here are some of the commonly used functions in the `cmd` module:

### `cmd.Cmd`

A simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters.

### `cmd.Cmd.cmdloop(intro=None)`

Repeatedly issue a prompt, accept input, parse an initial prefix off the received input, and dispatch to action methods, passing them the remainder of the line as an argument.

### `cmd.Cmd.precmd(line)`

Hook method executed just before the command line is interpreted, but after the input prompt is generated and issued.

### `cmd.Cmd.postcmd(stop, line)`

Hook method executed just after a command dispatch is finished.

### `cmd.Cmd.preloop()`

Hook method executed once when the `cmdloop()` method is called.

### `cmd.Cmd.postloop()`

Hook method executed once when the `cmdloop()` method is about to return.

### `cmd.Cmd.parseline(line)`

Parse the line into a command name and a string containing the arguments. Returns a tuple containing (command, args, line). 'command' and 'args' may be None if the line couldn't be parsed.

### `cmd.Cmd.onecmd(line)`

Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response to the prompt.

### `cmd.Cmd.emptyline()`

Called when an empty line is entered in response to the prompt. If this method is not overridden, it repeats the last nonempty command entered.

### `cmd.Cmd.default(line)`

Called on an input line when the command prefix is not recognized. If this method is not overridden, it prints an error message and returns.

### `cmd.Cmd.completedefault(*ignored)`

Method called to complete an input line when no command-specific `complete_*()` method is available. By default, it returns an empty list.

### `cmd.Cmd.completenames(text, *ignored)`

Return a list of all commands that match the given text.

### `cmd.Cmd.complete(text, state)`

Return the next possible completion for 'text'.

### `cmd.Cmd.get_names()`

Return a list of all the names in the class.

### `cmd.Cmd.complete_help(*args)`

Complete the help command.

### `cmd.Cmd.do_help(arg)`

List available commands with "help" or detailed help with "help cmd".

### `cmd.Cmd.print_topics(header, cmds, cmdlen, maxcol)`

Print the topics.

### `cmd.Cmd.columnize(list, displaywidth=80)`

Display a list of strings as a compact set of columns.

## Example

Here is an example of how you can use the `cmd` module to create a simple command-line interpreter:

````python
import cmd

class MyCmd(cmd.Cmd):
    def do_echo(self, arg):
        "Usage: echo <message>"
        print(arg)

    def do_greet(self, arg):
        "Usage: greet <name>"
        print(f"Hello, {arg}!")

    def do_EOF(self, arg):
        "Exit the interpreter"
        return True

if __name__ == '__main__':

    MyCmd().cmdloop()
````

In this example, we define a class `MyCmd` that inherits from `cmd.Cmd`. We then define three methods: `do_echo`, `do_greet`, and `do_EOF`. The `do_echo` method prints the message passed as an argument, the `do_greet` method prints a greeting message with the name passed as an argument, and the `do_EOF` method exits the interpreter.
